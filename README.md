# Credit_Risk_Analysis
# Overview 
The purose of the project was to determine the factors that may or may not increase the risk of a loan. Using a combination of machine learning models I attemeted to determine if credit risk could be predicted. The data set comprised of credit card data from LendingClub.

# Results
* Naive Random Oversampling

This model had a high degree of accuracy

* Smote Oversampling 

The results were simular to the Random Oversmapling

* Under sampling

Very balanced results with 64% accuracy and 65% sensitivity

* Combination of Over and under

This test seems to be the least balanced

* Balanced Random Forest

Very high accuracy and F1 scores

* Easy Ensemble

95% accuracy and a super high F1 score

# Summary
Given the goals of the project we should move forward with the Easy Ensemble modling. It gave us the highest degree of accuarcy.
